            <p>
              SamysAI builds AI powered systems, digital products, and growth infrastructure for businesses. Our work spans three connected areas: AI and automation, including phone callers and chatbots; digital development, covering web and app builds; and growth and operations, including cold email dashboards and content systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              These are not separate service lines. A chatbot is more useful when it is wired into the product it supports. An outreach dashboard is more useful when the content feeding it is planned alongside it. We build the pieces so they work together.
            </p>
            <p>
              We start from the business problem rather than the technology. If automation is the right answer, we automate. If the answer is a better tool, a cleaner process, or a simpler build, we do that instead.
